For educational purposes only. These repositories were written by me throughout my courses and studies to improve my skillsets.

### Dimension Reduction
You will find some intuitive approaches/explanation regarding PCA and SVD for dimension reduction, as well as an explanation for eigenvectors and eigenvalues. 
There is also an example with image compression.

### Machine Learning Handcode
These are code written from scratch in lieu of built in functions. You will be able to get a sense of what those built in functions are doing in the background. There are the following:

- SVD
- Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) + Window
- Inverse DFT
- K-means
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Expectation Maximization (EM)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
- Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
